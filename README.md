# Datasets
The adj_chengdu and adj_xian are the adjacency matrix that preserve the transitions of each region of chengdu and xi'an, respectively. They have 196 roads and 61 days data. Thus their shape is (61\*48,196\*196).

The chengdu_flow anf xian_flow  preserve the inflow and outflow of each region of chengdu and xi'an, respectively. their shape is (61\*48,196\*2).
